            <h2>Location</h2>
            <p>We’ll be celebrating in Carei, Romania, at Strada Viilor 1, 445100. The venue is a cozy event tent (indoors), and there’s parking available on-site. Children are welcome for the full day, including dinner.</p>

            <h2>Schedule</h2>
            <h3>Taking of the Bride (address & time will be shared)</h3>
            <p>The day starts at Evelin’s home, where family and friends will gather. This is a lively tradition, with little challenges along the way, sometimes for the groom and his family, who come to take Evelin to the church. There will also be a short goodbye speech from Evelin’s home, marking the start of this special day. It’s a symbolic send-off from her home and a way for everyone to celebrate the beginning of the wedding.</p>

            <h3>Church Ceremony (address & time will be shared)</h3>
            <p>Following this tradition, the wedding ceremony will take place at the church.</p>

            <h3>Reception & Dinner</h3>
            <p>After the ceremony, we’ll all move to the venue for dinner — children are welcome here too. The party really kicks off after the opening dance, and the evening will flow naturally with speeches, music, and dancing. Our band has two singers, one traditional, one modern (including English songs) — and a master of ceremonies will help guide the night in both Hungarian and English.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Background</h2>
            <p>We’ll be following Hungarian traditions, as Evelin’s family is part of the Hungarian minority in Romania. These traditions have been passed down through generations and are a way to celebrate family, community, and cultural identity.</p>
            <p>Historically, the Hungarian minority has lived in parts of Romania for centuries, keeping their language, customs, and unique celebrations alive despite changing borders and political climates.</p>
            <p>We’re also adding a few French touches to honor Guilhem’s heritage and blend our two cultures together.</p>

            <p>Cocktail attire. Please avoid wearing white. The average temperature in Carei on May 9 is between 10°C–22°C, so we recommend bringing a light coat or scarf for the evening.</p>
